		Two things that you should know about me
I'll treat your heart so tenderly
Lay give some love down at your feet
Come take my hand and you will see
A little bit of romance in every little moment
Good as gold
Trade you all my money for your gold
Worship you 'cause honey you're like gold
You'll be my queen
Worth your weight in gold
You're good as gold
Everyone wants a love that shines
But such a treasure's hard to find
More precious than a downtland mine, girl
I'll cherish you if you'll be mine
I will be your rich man, if you would take my hand
Good as gold
Trade you all my money for your gold
Worship you 'cause honey you're like gold
You'll be my queen
Worth your weight in gold
Copper, silver, energy
All those things I'd surely trade
Give them all away to make you mine
Gold
Trade you all my money for your gold
Worship you 'cause honey you're like gold
You'll be my queen
Worth your weight in gold
You're good as gold
Good as gold
Good as gold
You're good as gold
You're good as gold
Baby, baby
There will always be space for you and me
Right where you left it
And just maybe
Enough time will pass
We'll look back and laugh
Just don't forget it
And maybe I'm wrong
For writing this song
Losing my head over you
And I'll be here
'Cause we both know how it goes
I don't want things to change
I pray they stay the same, always
And I don't care
If you're with somebody else
I'll give you time and space
Just know I'm not a phase
I'm always, ways, ways
Always, ways, ways
I'm always, ways, ways
Pretty lady, used to walk with me
Down Bloor street, oh, what a time
And I still remember the fussin', the fightin, the fuckin', the lyin'
So fine, you'll always be mine
And maybe I'm wrong (hey babe, you could)
For writing this song (write me a song)
Losing my head over you
And I'll be here
'Cause we both know how it goes
I don't want things to change
I pray they stay the same, always
And I don't care
If you're with somebody else
I'll give you time and space
Just know I'm not a phase
I'm always, ways, ways
Always, ways, ways
I'm always, ways, ways
Always, count on it, sure as the stars in the sky
Always, you can count on it, sure as the sun will rise
Always, my love for you ain't goin' nowhere
Always, I will be here
I don't want another pretty face
I don't want just anyone to hold
I don't want my love to go to waste
I want you and your beautiful soul
I know that you are something special
To you, I'd be always faithful
I want to be what you always needed
Then I hope you'll see the heart in me
I don't want another pretty face
I don't want just anyone to hold
I don't want my love to go to waste
I want you and your beautiful soul
You're the one I wanna chase
You're the one I wanna hold
I won't let another minute go to waste
I want you and your beautiful soul
Your beautiful soul, yeah
You might need time to think it over
But I'm just fine moving forward
I'll ease your mind if you give me the chance
I will never make you cry, c'mon let's try
I don't want another pretty face
I don't want just anyone to hold
I don't want my love to go to waste
I want you and your beautiful soul
You're the one I wanna chase
You're the one I wanna hold
I won't let another minute go to waste
I want you and your beautiful soul
Am I crazy for wanting you?
Maybe do you think you could want me too?
I don't want to waste your time
Do you see things the way I do?
I just want to know that you feel it too
There is nothing left to hide
I don't want another pretty face
I don't want just anyone to hold
I don't want my love to go to waste
I want you and your beautiful soul
You're the one I wanna chase
You're the one I wanna hold
I won't let another minute go to waste
I want you and your soul
I don't want another pretty face
I don't want just anyone to hold
I don't want my love to go to waste
I want you and your beautiful soul
Beautiful soul, yeah
Oh, yeah
Your beautiful soul, yeah
Broken all the pieces I've been shaping lately
Focused on the things that didn't make no sense
Guess that growing up was never meant to be easy
Yeah, I got used to doing everything sideways
Didn't really care about how everyone felt
Hiding my emotions down in different ashtrays
Oh, but what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I went down a road that only got me nowhere
I've seen every corner, every inch of this place
Being all alone it really got me thinking
Maybe overthinking
That what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
Hide these beautiful scars
Hide these beautiful scars
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
Hide these
I ain't gonna hide these
Hide these
Hide these beautiful scars
No
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called Yellow
So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow
Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
And you know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so
I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow
And your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
And you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
It's true
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do
